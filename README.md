# üìñtech-blog
This is the Challenge-14 related to Model-View-Controller (MVC)

## Description
This project, titled "Tech Blog", is a CMS-style blog site similar to a WordPress site, built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The application allows users to publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts as well. It utilizes technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, and Sequelize for the back-end, and Handlebars.js for the front-end. The application is deployed on Render and uses a PostgreSQL database for data persistence.
